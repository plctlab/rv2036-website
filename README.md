# RISC-V Prosperity 2036

## Background

Today, the RISC-V ecosystem has entered a phase of exponential growth. In the past 18 months, RISC-V has seen breakthrough in high performance server chips, desktop operating systems, mobile and wearable devices, AIoT, automotive systems, information security, and many other fields. In 2025, we expect to see the number of developers growing past a million and RISC-V super computers will enter the TOP500 list (with TOP10 projected for 2030).

With the development of computer architecture and foundational software platforms entering a “golden age” of rapid growth, open instruction set architectures such as RISC-V brought forth new scientific problems and engineering challenges. As leading contributors to the RISC-V ecosystem, we invite friends and experts around the globe to join us in this long-term collective effort to realize the goals of RISC-V Prosperity 2036.

## Vision & Mission

2024 is the year of the dragon, with 2036 coming up as the next.

RISC-V Prosperity 2036 aims to realize a mature RISC-V’s hardware and software ecosystem akin to that of the other mainstream architectures by the next year of the dragon, 2036. This means mainstream-level maturity in applications such as datacenters, desktop computing, wearable technologies, and Internet of things - all implemented with systems of open standards and open source system software stacks.

## Goals

1. Bringing a joint effort of over 100 chip and solutions manufacturers and over 500 software development firms, in order to port, optimize, and deploy over 1,000 key commercial software packages across 18 essential industries.
2. Developing solutions suitable for commercial applications around high-performance RISC-V chips and IPs such as SG2380 and XiangShan, helping our target industries. These industries include AI acceleration, edge computing, storage, robotics, computer-assisted industrial simulation, computer-assisted medical solutions, and many more.
3. Building a human resource development effort for RISC-V to network over 10,000 potential experts in RISC-V chip design, software development, community management, as well as education and training. This will allow us to enable a industry-wide human resource network.

## Joint Initiators: ASE Lab, PLCT Lab, and SOPHGO
 
The Automated Software Engineering Lab (ASE Lab) was founded in 2005. The lab strives for intellectual leadership in software tooling and commits to a long-term investment in automation and intelligent software application innovations. The ASE Lab’s scientific research outputs are well renowned in the global field of software research. The Lab’s joint project with Microsoft, Pex, has been integrated in Visual Studio’s IntelliTest suite since 2025. ASE Lab is committed to training new field experts in technological innovations in foundational software.

The Programming Language and Compiler Technologies Lab (PLCT Lab) was founded in 2019, with a focus to lead research and adoption in open source compiler technologies and foundational toolchain and runtime software infrastructure. The PLCT Lab is well equipped both technically and adminsitratively to organize development, maintenance, and management of key software infrastructures. The Lab is committed to train over 10,000 top-tier experts in compiler technology and disseminate compiler technological knowledge in China.

SOPHGO is a RISC-V and TPU compute hardware vendor that strives to become a world-class provider for general computing power. SOPHGO is committed to a open source and open standard vision, joinining industry partners in implementing and manufacturing high-performance RISC-V general computing products. Strategy-wise, SOPHGO follows a “cloud, edge, and endpoint” product matrix, designing computing products and full solutions for application in datacenters, AIGC, city management, intelligent manufacturing, smart terminals, and many more scenarios.
